# QO-100-WB-Live-Tune

This Windows Application grabs the fft data from the batc Wideband Spectrum monitor page and allows the user to click on signals which automatically configures Minitioune to the required settings to receive the signal. 

You can control upto 4 receivers, just edit the minitioune ini file for each instance to use a different port.
No need to edit anything if you are just using one receiver.

Various parts of the code come from the batc page javascriipt here: https://eshail.batc.org.uk/wb/
